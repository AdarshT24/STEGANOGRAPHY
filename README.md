# STEGANOGRAPHY

Steganography is the practice of hiding a secret message in something that is not secret. But cyber attackers use steganography to do more than share messages.

This project is based on Steganography using python GUI in which you can hide and see secret message in form of image or text file (.jpg , .png , .txt) .
