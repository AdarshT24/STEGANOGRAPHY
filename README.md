# STEGANOGRAPHY

Steganography is the practice of hiding a secret message in something that is not secret. But cyber attackers use steganography to do more than share messages.

Steganography can be a way which makes it possible to send news and information without being censored and without the fear of the messages being intercepted and traced back to us.
The formula below describes the process of steganography as discussed above:

cover_medium + hidden_data + stego_key = stego_medium
he explanation of this formula is,

The cover medium refers to the file that we are going to put our information on it.
Hidden data obviously is the data we want to keep secret.
An encryption advanced which is a choice for us.

This project is based on Steganography using python GUI in which you can hide and see secret message in form of image or text file (.jpg , .png , .txt) .
